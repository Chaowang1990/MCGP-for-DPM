This file is an online-appendix for high-resolution figures presented in the paper "Modeling and prediction of driving performance measures based on multi-output convolutional Gaussian process" by Pranaykumar Kasarla, Chao Wang, Timothy L. Brown, and Daniel McGehee from the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Iowa.

This file contains four sets of figures that correspond to the 4 different data setting in the paper. In each set, standard deviation of lateral lane position (SDLP) and standard deviation of driving speed (SDS) figures are presented in a .fig file, which can be read by Matlab.

A .svg file is also provided in each set for a high-resolution access.
